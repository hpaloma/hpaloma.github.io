  <h3>Tip #1: Get creative with camp spots!</h3>

  <p>In a vlog by Mav, he decides to camp on an emergency high tide tower at the Bay of Fundy, which is an arm of the gulf of Maine. H was curious to see what it would be like, and it ended up being a very fun experience! Don't be afraid to poke around areas and think outside the box for different camp spots, you never know what you may find!    </p>
<br>
<br>
  <h3> Tip #2: Dry meals save space</h3>

  <p>When backpacking, Mav mentions how he does not like to pack heavy due to the weight. Because of this, he brings dry meals to save space, instead of bringing multiple ingredients. For this vlog, Mav brought Mac and cheese that could rehydrate with boiling water!    </p>

  <h3>Tip #3: Invest in a carbon monoxide detector</h3>

  <p>In a vlog by Mav, he goes truck camping in Colorado's 4th worst blizzard. Because it's so cold, he uses a propane heater to keep him warm. His enclosed area combined with the heater makes it a risk for carbon monoxide poisoning, so he shows us the detector he uses! Always be safe when running your car for heat/using a propane heater.  </p>
<br>
<br>
  <h3> Tip #2: Dress accordingly for snow</h3>

  <p>When camping in the snow, especially a blizzard, it's important to dress warm. It is especially important to wear proper footwear, such as as boots. The boot length should be tall, so that snow does not get into it. Man did not pack accordingly and brought short length boots during a blizzard.  </p>

  <h3>Tip #5: Propane Tanks for Heat</h3>

  <p>In a vlog by Mav, he goes into Cub foods and buys out all of their propane tanks. This amount of tanks is truly necessary for the cold truck camping he was about to endure. The propane tanks fuel the stove as well as his heater, which was useful since it was -19 degrees outside. If you plan to cook or use a separate heater, don't forget to pack propane tanks!  </p>
<br>
<br>
  <h3> Tip #6: Don't leave your car alone for very long</h3>

  <p>When in Vancouver, Mav had his truck parked in the city with all of his gear in it. When he came back to leave, his window was smashed and some things got stolen. Please be wary of leaving personal belongings in your car, at campsites, in cities, anywhere!<p>
